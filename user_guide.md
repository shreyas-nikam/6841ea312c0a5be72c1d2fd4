# Investment Base Pairs Lab: A User Guide

## Introduction
Duration: 00:05:00

This codelab introduces you to the Investment Base Pairs Lab, a Streamlit application designed to explore and analyze investment strategies.  The lab uses simulated data to illustrate key concepts in investment performance, allowing you to interactively investigate the relationships between different asset classes and investment signals. You will explore data visualization and performance attribution techniques. No prior knowledge of financial modeling is required.


## Exploring Investment Data
Duration: 00:10:00

This section guides you through the "Data Exploration" page of the application.  Here, you can examine a dataset containing information about various asset classes (Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities), different signal types (Value, Momentum, Carry), and their associated performance metrics.

1. Navigate to the "Data Exploration" page using the sidebar on the left.

2. Examine the provided table which contains detailed data such as returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios and several measures of signal predictability and imbalance.

3. Use the dropdown menu to select a specific "Asset Class".  The application will filter the data and display a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between Return and Volatility for the selected asset class. Hover over the points on the scatter plot to see the corresponding "Signal Type". This visualization helps understand the risk-return profiles of different investment strategies within each asset class.


## Analyzing Performance Drivers
Duration: 00:05:00

This section takes you to the "Performance Analysis" page to understand what drives investment performance.

1. Navigate to the "Performance Analysis" page using the sidebar.

2. You will see a bar chart displaying the contribution of various key drivers to overall investment performance.  These drivers include factors like own-asset predictability, cross-asset predictability, correlation between signals, and unexplained effects.  This helps you to quickly understand the relative importance of various performance-driving factors.


## Conclusion
Duration: 00:02:00
